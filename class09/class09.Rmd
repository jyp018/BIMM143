```

## K-means clustering 

This main k-means function in R is called `kmeans()`. Let's play with it here.

```{r}
# Generate some example data for clustering
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3), rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```

Use the kmeans() function setting k to 2 and nstart=20
```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers = 2, nstart = 20)
km
```

Inspect/print the results

Q. How many points are in each cluster? 
Q. What ‘component’ of your result object details
 - cluster size?
 - cluster assignment/membership?
 - cluster center?
 
```{r}
#cluster size
km$size
```
 
```{r}
km$cluster
```
 
 
```{r}
length(km$cluster)
table(km$cluster)
```
 
Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and
 add cluster centers as blue points
 
```{r}
plot(x, col=km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col= "blue", pch= 15, cex= 1)
```
 
 
## Hierarchial clustering in R

The main Hierarchical clustering function in R is called `hclust()`.
An important point here is that you have to calculate the distance maxtrix deom 
your input data before calling `hclust()`. 

```{r}
# We will use our x again from above...
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```

Folks often view the results of Hierarchical clustering graphically. 
Lets try passing this to the `plot()` function.
```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=10, col="red", lty=3)
abline(h=6, col="blue", lty=1)
```

To get cluster membership vector I need to "cut" the tree at a certain height to yield my seperate cluster branches.
```{r}
cutree(hc, h=6)
```

```{r}
gp4 <- cutree(hc, k=6)
```

Let's try with some more real like data...

```{r}
# Step 1. Generate some example data for clustering
x <- rbind(
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c1
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), ncol = 2), # c2
 matrix(c(rnorm(50, mean = 1, sd = 0.3), # c3
 rnorm(50, mean = 0, sd = 0.3)), ncol = 2))
colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")
# Step 2. Plot the data without clustering
plot(x)
# Step 3. Generate colors for known clusters
# (just so we can compare to hclust results)
col <- as.factor( rep(c("c1","c2","c3"), each=50) )
plot(x, col=col)
```

Q. Use the `dist()`, `hclust()`, `plot()` and `cutree()`
 functions to return 2 and 3 clusters
 
Q. How does this compare to your known 'col' groups?

```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(x))
plot(hc)
abline(h=1.7, col="red")
```

To get cluster membership vector use `cutree()` and then use `table()`
to tabulate up how many members in each cluster we have.
```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, k=3)
grps
table(grps)
```

Make a plpot with our cluster results 
```{r}
plot(x, col=grps)
```


## PCA of UK food data
```{r}
x <- read.csv("UK_foods.csv", row.names=1)
```

Lets make some plots to explore our data a bit more
```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```


A "pairs" plot can be helpful when we have small datasets like this one but often we are dealing with data that is too large for these apporaches :-(

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) `prcomp()`
```{r}
pca <- prcomp( t(x) )
#pca
```

What is in my result object `pca`? I can check the attributes...
```{r}
attributes(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab = "PC2")
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], colnames(x), col= c("grey","red","blue","darkgreen"))
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```
